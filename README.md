## Adjustments to explore
1. Adding more node types:
    - $\sqrt{}$
    - $\log$
    - $\exp$
2. Coefficient optimization:
    - Adam
    - SGD
3. Mutation/Crossover:
    - subtree crossover
    - subtree mutation
    - crossover chance (currently $p=0.25$)
4. Symmetry:
    - left/right thrusters
5. Memory:
    - Record past states
    - potential for smoothing behaviour



## Plan of Attack

For each of the adjustment that we explore, we will create new, parametrized,  functions. This will allow us to easily distinguish between the original code, and the modified code that we created.

The original and new code implementations can be loaded in the `solutions.ipynb`
