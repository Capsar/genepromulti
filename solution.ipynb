    "## Optimisation\n",
    "The coefficients in the multi-tree aren't optimised. Here Q-learning (taken from https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/reinforcement_q_learning.html) is used to optimise the weights further. Incorporate coefficient optimisation in training your agent(s). Coefficient Optimisation can be expensive. Think about how often you want to optimise, when, which individuals etc."
